# CS440-Project

#### Introduction
The following project is built to recognize clickbait articles from their titles. Clickbait articles are uninformative and clutter websites with distracting content, which users donâ€™t care for. The end goal is to eventually block those clickbait advertisements from websites. In this project we will explore concepts developed for artificial intelligence learning and problem solving through algorithms that have been taught in the CS 440 class, and use them to investigate the problem, develop steps that will be tasked to each member, and make a schedule for when we will have them completed. 

#### AI problem/algorithm of exploration
It will be using a probabilistic language model. The goal is to be able to take a random news article title from a large data set, and the program will be able to determine how likely this title is a clickbait article, or that of a legitimate news article.

#### Steps to investigate the project
The steps include collecting data of known clickbait article titles, known legitimate news article titles, and a dataset of both clickbait and legitimate news article titles. The program will run through the first two datasets so that it learns the probability of a title being that of a clickbait article or that of a legitimate news article. The third dataset is used as a test run of the program, and is randomised as to which title is a clickbait article and which is not. The program will determine how likely the title is categorised using the probabilistic language model.

#### Tasks each team member will do: 
Joshua Burris: Collect data of clickbait article titles, Draw conclusion

Caleb Tong: Collect data of legitimate news article titles, Analyze results

Together: Construct the probabilistic language model and run it
